## About the Project

While working on this project via [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), I learned/practiced some of the very important JavaScript concepts and had a chance to learn a new great tool: Firebase!

- `import`
- Object -> Array
- `createElement`
- Flexbox: `flex-wrap` and `gap`
- `user-select`

- Firebase:
  -- `initializeApp`
  -- `getDatabase`
  -- `reference`
  -- `push`
  -- `onValue`
  -- `snapshot`
  -- `remove`

- Web Application Manifest

In order to distinguish the app from Scriba's design, I created my own colo palette, changed the logo & image of the app, and also added extra features, such as disabling item addition if user doesn't fill anything out, adding items on Enter key press and captalization of 1st letter of each item to give it a consistent look.

## Credits
Thank you, [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) for the free [shopping cart](https://www.freepik.com/icon/shopping-cart_4529740) icon!

## Tools
The app was built with the help of these tools:
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data in realtime
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - create your own color palette, or pick an existing one
- [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - awesome `png` to `ico` generator
